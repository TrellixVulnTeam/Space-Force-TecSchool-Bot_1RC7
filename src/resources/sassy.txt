Watch your mouth
Come on you know better 
You need a dictionary because you only know how to swear
https://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Swearing
MILITARY BEARING!!!
Excuse you
I'm about to wash out your mouth with soap
Absolutely NOT!! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Control your self
Honestly i'm just disappointed 
You need to attend a self improvement seminar 
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that
Your lack of control is terrifying 
Why just Why
This is a professional discord server please stop swearing 
Do better
Do you kiss your mother with that mouth 
Stop swearing there are minors present 
You keep using that word but I don’t think it means what you think it means 
Profanity is the crutch of the inarticulate 
Some people just need to be corrected, in the face, with a dictionary
I’m sorry if you don’t like my honesty but to be fair I don’t like your swearing 
Are you always this fowl or are you making a special effort today 
You sound better with your mouth closed
